# EurKEY - MSKLC Files

This folder contains the MSKLC files for versions 1.1 to 1.3 beta, extracted from the installation DLLs, which can be used to edit the keyboard layouts and to rebuild the installation files.

Note that there is also a corrected EurKEY v1.3 beta, having the math symbols back again.
